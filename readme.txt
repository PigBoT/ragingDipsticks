Welcome to the repository for Raging Dipsticks!
.
Online golf game

Basic Features: Multi-players interface, the user will be able to manipulate a golf ball (solid-filled circle) on an image background using a physics engine commensurate with Dipsticks’ resources. Once the center pixel of the ball passes over a designated area of pixels representing the hole, the user completes the course. 

At minimum, the user will be able to control the ball’s direction and trigger its release. Magnitude may be fixed, along with the ball’s angle of ricochet and rate of deceleration. A set of boundaries will be defined against which the ball will “bounce” following a collision. Dipsticks may use the same frame of boundaries with an alternating background image for multiple fairways. 

the user will be able to control the magnitude of the ball’s motion, and its collisions will follow some basic trigonometric rules for Newtonian mechanics for greater realism. Different boundary frames may be set for different courses. A score card may be implemented.
