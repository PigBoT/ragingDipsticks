#in your git project directory
git remote add upstream https://github.com/PigBoT/ragingDipsticks.git

#now confirm that the original branch has been linked by running
git remote -v

#your output should appear similar to this, reflecting your original url and the upstream url
#> origin  https://github.com/SonOfLysander/ragingDipsticks.git (fetch)
#> origin  https://github.com/SonOfLysander/ragingDipsticks.git (push)
#> upstream        https://github.com/PigBoT/ragingDipsticks.git (fetch)
#> upstream        https://github.com/PigBoT/ragingDipsticks.git (push)

git fetch upstream
git add .\readme.txt #you may have to type it as just readme.txt without the .\
git commit -m "We are adding the changes from the original"
git merge upstream/master
git push #at this point you will see a warning indicating that the default push action will change when they release git 2.0. I don't know what the difference is yet, but for now just let it go along with the default old behavior and don't change it to the new one.
